Real-World Problem It Solves
Modern computing demands hands-free, context-aware automation. This project implements a modular, extensible voice assistant capable of natural language command parsing, dynamic task execution, and multi-source data retrieval. It simulates real-world assistant systems like Siri or Google Assistant for desktop automation, multimedia control, and information retrieval.
ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Architecture
Programming Language: Python 3.x â€“ leveraging object-oriented paradigms for modularity
Core Libraries & Frameworks:
